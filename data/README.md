# Spotify Dataset

## About the Dataset
This dataset is collected from Spotify's API using two Python scripts to extract both popular and non-popular songs along with their associated audio and descriptive features.

- **Descriptive Features** provide metadata about the track, such as artist name, album name, and release date.
- **Audio Features** are derived from Spotify's audio analysis and describe musical attributes such as tempo, danceability, and energy.

The dataset combines both feature types for analysis and experimentation.
